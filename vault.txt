##Obsidian HelpStart hereHi there!I’m a note in your vault.At the same time, I’m also just a Markdown file sitting on your hard disk.It’s all in plain text, so you don’t need toworry about losing me in case [Obsidian] disappears one day.Quick StartIf you’re in a hurry, here’s some quick places to dive in:The [Command palette] contains most of the commands you need to work with Obsidian.Just press Ctrl/Cmd-P and start typing.How to [[Create notes|create new notes]].How to create [[Internal link|internal links]]How to use Markdown to [Format your notes]How to [embed files], or embed other notes[Use hotkeys]How to [[Working with multiple notes|open multiple files side by side]]Obsidian can be extended with [[Core plugins|plugins]].
Several are available by default, and can beenabled or disabled according to your needs.If you want a more thorough introduction, including a bit about our philosophy, check out [Obsidian].And if you’d like a gentle introduction, or just want to get started but don’t know how, head over to [Basic notetaking].If you are a Catalyst supporter, and want to turn on Insider Builds, see [Insider builds].WorkflowsObsidian is a tool that can be used in many ways, from a simple list of notes to a very powerful knowledgemanagement system. We suggest you start at your own pace, and build it into the tool you need.Here are a few ways to get started:If you want to just start taking notes, check out [Basic note taking]If you already have a collection of notes in markdown format, just choose them for your Vault.Choose “Vault” inthe lower left and select the directory your notes are in.If you have notes from Roam Research, Notion, or other systems, [[Import data|here’s how to import them]].
If you’d like to know more about Obsidian, you can [[Obsidian|read about our story]].By the way, you can feel free to edit these help docs, but when you open it again, they will be overwritten. So,don’t put anything in them you want to keep.I have questions.Then you should join our community!.We have active Discord and Forums, and the community is generally quitehelpful.Advanced topicsHTML sanitizationObsidian sanitizes html for security reasons.Because it runs locally, scripting vulnerabilities are a more seriousproblem than they would be in a web applications.Accordingly, we are probably a bit more strict than you may beused to, and you may run into issues if you try to do things like embedding <script> tags in a note.However,the vast majority of people will never encounter issues with this.Accepted file formatsObsidian recognizes the following file formats right now:1.Markdown files: md ;2.Image files: png , jpg , jpeg , gif , bmp , svg ;3.
Audio files: mp3 , webm , wav , m4a , ogg , 3gp , flac ;4. Video files: mp4 , webm , ogv ;5.PDF files: pdf .All these types of files can be [[Embed files|embedded]] in a note.Community pluginsObsidian allows developers to write community plugins to extend Obsidian’s functionality.Right now, the plugin API is in alpha status.This means any part of the API could introduce breaking changes in afuture release.For developersFor instructions on creating new plugins, see our sample plugin.For documentation on the API, check out our plugin API repo.After you created your plugin, you can add it to our community plugin marketplace by creating a pull request inour releases repo.Refer to the sample plugin on how to release updates for your plugin.For usersSafe ModeBy default, Obsidian has Safe Mode turned on to protect you from potential harm.
Under Safe Mode, nocommunity plugin will run.Please be aware that community plugins can access files on your computer, connect to the internet, and eveninstall additional programs. To read more about plugin security, [[#Plugin security|see here]].In order to install community plugins, you need to turn off Safe Mode in Settings -> Community plugin -> SafeMode.Discover and install community pluginsAfter disabling Safe Mode, you can find community plugins created by the community in Settings -> Communityplugin -> Community plugins -> Browse.On this page, you can browse plugins by popularity, or search for specific plugins.Click on a plugin to see detailsand instruction from the plugin author.In the details page, you can click “Install” to install a plugin.After installing, you can then find the installed plugins under Settings -> Community plugin.They need to beenabled in order to take effect.You can also uninstall them there.Plugin securityThanks for trusting Obsidian with your data!
It means a lot to us, and we take security very seriously. Thatincludes community plugins too.Due to technical reasons with our platform, we’re unable to restrict plugins to a specific permission or accesslevel.Since we offer Obsidian for free, currently we’re unable to manually review each plugin.The good news is that Obsidian has an amazing and passionate community, so we rely on community trust toensure security of community plugins.In general, you should be able to trust most of the popular plugins from the community.We require all communitycommunity plugins to be open sourced on GitHub.If you’re working with sensitive data, we recommend youto inspect the plugin code before installing it, so that your security needs are met.You can find a link to theplugin repository on the plugin detail page.If you find any security flaws with community plugins, contact the plugin author by adding an issue on GitHub.
Ifyou believe the plugin is malicious, contact us to get the plugin investigated and removed.Insider builds Insider builds are experimental versions of Obsidian that are released to Catalyst license owners, on an opt-inbasis.Please note that insider builds are less stable than public versions, so if you prefer a smoother version, you don’thave to enable it.How to enable insider buildIf you are a [[Catalyst license|Catalyst supporter]], you have access to Insider Builds before the general public.To access these, go to Settings => Account, and log in with the password you used on the Obsidian site. Then goto Settings => About, and turn on Insider Builds there.![[Insider.png]]Report issuesIf you’re on our Discord server, you can go to the #insider-build channel to report issues.
If you’re filing a bugreport on the forum, be sure to note the version you’re using, so that we can improve it before rolling it out toeveryone.Drag and DropThere are many ways to drag and drop things around Obsidian to make the experience smoother:Drag panesSee [[Working with multiple notes#5 Panes can be rearranged by dragging|dragging panes]]Drag sourcesYou can drag a file, or multiple files from the [file explorer].You can drag a file from a [search] result.You can drag a file from [backlinks] or unlinked references.You can drag a file from the [starred notes].You can drag a file from a link inside the note, in preview mode.Drop destinationsYou can drop a file on a pane header to open the file there. Hold Alt (or Shift on MacOS) to dropanywhere on the pane.You can drop a file on a folder in the [file explorer] to move the file there.You can drop a file into an editor to insert it as a link.
The generated link also follows your preferences,such as relative paths, or using markdown links. You can drop a file on the [starred notes] to star it.Dragging from outside ObsidianYou can drag any HTML content from the browser into Obsidian to automatically convert them intoMarkdownYou can drag and drop any files from your native file explorer to have Obsidian import (make a copy of)those files in your vault’s attachment folder and insert them as internal links.Hold Ctrl to create file:/// absolute links to those files instead of importing a copy.Dropping files outside ObsidianThis will create an obsidian:// URL in the external application for the Obsidian note that you dragged.Contributing to ObsidianThanks for the interest in contributing to Obsidian!There are three major ways you can contribute:1.
Financial contributionCommercial licenseIf you’d like to use Obsidian for work activities, try to let your work get you a [[Commercial license|commerciallicense]].Add-on servicesIf you’d like to make a website from your notes, consider getting [Obsidian Publish] if the price works for you.If you’re interested in an end-to-end encryption syncing solution, we also offer [Obsidian Sync]. In addition toend-to-end encryption, Obsidian Sync also comes with version history.CatalystIf you don’t need any of the above, you can get a [Catalyst license] to support our developer, which also givesyou access to [Insider builds].Obsidian UnlimitedFor those very passionate about the project, there’s also the Obsidian Unlimited option, which lets you pay asmuch as you want to support development and help us stay independent.We recommend going for this optionafter you’ve purchased the VIP tier of [Catalyst license] so that you can enjoy the benefits.2.
Extending Obsidian CSS themesIf you’re proficient in CSS, another way is to contribute a theme, so that people who don’t know CSS can enjoyyour work. If you decide to do so, feel free to share it on the #css-themes channel on Discord, or in the Share &Showcase category on our forum.If you’d like to add your theme to the community theme list, let us know!(Or we might reach out to you first!)PluginsIf you’re a JavaScript/TypeScript programmer, you can write [Community plugins] for Obsidian, now that ourplugin API is in alpha.3.Translation and proofreadingTranslating the interfaceIf you know another language (preferably natively), you can help with translating the Obsidian interface into yourlanguage.You can do that by submitting a pull request in our translation GitHub repository to get it into the nextversion of the app.Translating the docsWe’re in the middle of reorganizing and stabilizing the documentation you’re reading right now.
Once it’s in agood shape, you can also help translate it, so that people who don’t know English can also easily learn to useObsidian.Found a typo?If you found a typo or a grammar mistake in these documentation, feel free to submit a pull request in ourdocumentation repository.Using obsidian URIObsidian supports a custom URI protocol obsidian:// which can be used to trigger various actions within theapp. This is commonly used on MacOS and mobile apps for automation and cross-app workflows.If you have Obsidian installed, this link will open the app on your device: Click hereInstalling Obsidian URITo make sure your operating system redirect obsidian:// URIs to the Obsidian app, there may be additionalsteps you need to perform.On Windows, running the app once should be sufficient.This will register for the obsidian:// customprotocol handler in the Windows registry.
On MacOS, running the app once should be sufficient, however, your app must be installer version 0.8.12or later.On Linux, there’s a much more involved process:First, ensure you create a obsidian.desktop file. See here for detailsEnsure that your desktop file specifies the Exec field as Exec=executable %u .The %u is usedto pass the obsidian:// URIs to the app.If you’re using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage--appimage-extract .Then make sure the Exec directive points to the unpacked executable.Using Obsidian URIsObsidian URIs are typically in this format:obsidian://action?param1=value&param2;=valueThe action is usually the action that you would like to perform.Encoding==Important==Ensure that your values are properly URI encoded.
For example, forward slash characters / must be encodedas %2F and space characters must be encoded as %20 .This is especially important because an improperly encoded “reserved” character may break the interpretation ofthe URI. See here for detailsAvailable actionsAction open Description: Opens an Obsidian vault, and possibly open a file within that vault.Possible parameters: vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.The vault name is simply the name of the vault folder.The vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault.This ID is unique per folder onyour computer.Example: ef6ca3e3b524d22f .There isn’t an easy way to find this ID yet, one willbe offered at a later date in the vault switcher.Currently it can be found in %appdata%/obsidian/obsidian.json for Windows.For MacOS, replace %appdata% with ~/Library/Application Support/ .For Linux, replace %appdata% with ~/.config/ .
file can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file.To resolve the target file, Obsidian uses the same link resolution system as a regular [[wikilink]] within the vault.If the file extension is md , the extension can be omitted. path an absolute file system path to a file.Using this parameter will override both vault and file .This will cause the app to search for the most specific vault which contains the specified file path.Then the rest of the path replaces the file parameter.Examples: obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault This opens the vault my vault .If the vault is already open, focus on the window.obsidian://open?vault=ef6ca3e3b524d22f This opens the vault identified by the ID ef6ca3e3b524d22f .obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note This opens the note my note in the vault my vault , assuming my note exists and the file is my note.md .
obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note.md This also opens the note my note in the vault my vault . obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file;=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note This opens the note located at path/to/my note in the vault my vault .obsidian://open?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fmy%20vault%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note This will look for any vault that contains the path /home/user/my vault/path/to/my note .Then, the rest ofthe path is passed to the file parameter.For example, if a vault exists at /home/user/my vault , then thiswould be equivalent to file parameter set to path/to/my note .obsidian://open?path=D%3A%5CDocuments%5CMy%20vault%5CMy%20note This will look for any vault that contains the path D:\Documents\My vault\My note .Then, the rest of thepath is passed to the file parameter.For example, if a vault exists at D:\Documents\My vault , then thiswould be equivalent to file parameter set to My note .
Action search Description: Opens the search pane for a vault, and optionally perform a search query.Possible parameters: vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action open .query (optional) The search query to perform.Examples: obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault This opens the vault my vault , and opens the search pane.obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault&query;=MOC This opens the vault my vault , opens the search pane, and performs a search for MOC .Action new Description: Creates a new note in the vault, optionally with some content.Possible parameters: vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.Same as action open .name the file name to be created.If this is specified, the file location will be chosen based on your“Default location for new notes” preferences.file a vault absolute path, including the name.Will override name if specified.path a globally absolute path.
Works similar to the path option in the open action, which will overrideboth vault and file . content (optional) the contents of the note.silent (optional) set this if you don’t want to open the new note.Examples: obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&name;=my%20note This opens the vault my vault , and creates a new note called my note .obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&path;=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note This opens the vault my vault , and creates a new note at path/to/my note .Action hook-get-address Description: Endpoint for use with Hook.Copies a markdown link of the current focused note to the clipboard, asan obsidian://open URL.Use: obsidian://hook-get-address Possible parameters: vault (optional) can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.
If not provided, the current or last focusedvault will be used.Shorthand formatsIn addition to the formats above, there are two more “shorthand” formats available to open vaults and files: obsidian://vault/my vault/my note is equivalent to obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note obsidian:///absolute/path/to/my note is equivalent to obsidian://open?path=%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note Deleting filesObsidian has several options for dealing with deleted files, depending on your needs.By default, deleted files are sent to your system trash. Here you can use whatever means your system hasfor recovering files you’ve accidentally deleted.Deleted files can be sent to a special .trash directory in your Vault.
This can be useful if you want theability to recover your Vault files separate from your system trash.You can also set obsidian to just delete files without possibility of recovery.These options can be found in Settings → Files & Links.Customizing CSSIf you are building or modifying your own css, you can open the developer tools by using Ctrl+Shift+I onWindows/Linux or Cmd+Opt+I on macOS to get information on the elements you want to customize.Changes to themes and snippets will be detected automatically and reapplied.
You do not need to restart theapp.New to CSSIf you’re new to CSS, our community has put together a quick guide to get comfortable with CSS:Getting Comfortable with CSSKlaas also put together a helpful index of common CSS snippets that you can feel free to mix and match:Obsidian CSS Snippets (on GitHub) YAML front matteraliases: front matterYAML, also known as front matter, is designed to be file-level metadata that is readable by humans and Obsidian.Front matter is a section of plain text attributes that starts at the first line of the file. It is one of the most popularways to add metadata in a Markdown file, and has been popularized by static generators such as Jekyll, Hugo,and Gatsby.A YAML block needs triple dashes at the start and end to be read by Obsidian (and other apps).
==It also needsto be placed at the very top of the file.==For example:key: valuekey2: value2key3: [one, two, three]key4:- four- five- six---As of 0.12.12, there are four keys natively supported:- tags ([[Working with tags|more information]])- aliases ([[Add aliases to note|more information]])- cssclass - publish ([[Publish#YAML support for Publish|more information]])As Obsidian continues to develop, we will gradually make it more accessible by plugin developers, and make itmore user friendly.How Obsidian stores dataWe believe [[Obsidian#How we’re different|your data is always yours to own and control]]. Your notes are storedin markdown, which is an open format based on plain text files, and so should be readable in the future by anycomputer that can deal with text files.You can freely edit notes in other software, even while having them openin Obsidian.Per vault dataThere is, however, some data that is needed by the software that is not stored in markdown.
Obsidian creates adirectory called .obsidian in the root of any vault you create. This contains your configuration, includingcustom hotkeys and which plugins are enabled.Any directory starting with a .is invisible on most systems, soyou will probably never see it unless you try.If you delete this directory, none of your data will be gone, but you will lose your custom settings.It will be recreated when you open that vault in Obsidian again.If you are using git , it’s probably best to ignore the .obsidian/workspace file, because the this file stores your panesand opened files, but we haven’t observed any other issues with including it.System directoryObsidian also stores some information in the system directory.This is different per Operating System; on Mac it’s /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian , on Windows %APPDATA%\Obsidian\ ,and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Obsidian/ or ~/.config/Obsidian/ on Linux.
As a result, we recommend againstcreating a vault in this directory.Aside from that, though, you can create a Vault anywhere your operating system will allow. Obsidian files syncfine with Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, git, and every other syncing service we’ve tried thus far.Symbolic LinksStarting in v0.11.1, Obsidian will recognize symbolic links and junctions.We do not officially recommend usingthese, but we recognize there are valid use-cases for them.Use them at your own risk.Beware that there are many pitfalls to using symbolic links, and some of them could have serious consequencessuch as data-loss, file corruption, or could crash Obsidian.Below are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind:Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop.Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets.Disjoint means onefolder does not contain another, or vice versa.
Obsidian will ignore any symlink to a parent folder of thevault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure youdon’t end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous.Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or any other kind of sync.If the target of a symlink is itselfa directory that’s synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts ordata loss.Some sync tools (e.g.git) do not follow symlinks, but rather synchronize the path the symlinkpoints to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way.Obsidian’s file manager cannot move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on adifferent drive from your vault, you will not be able to drag files between that folder and other folders usingObsidian’s file explorer.
(You’ll need to use your OS’s explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see themove as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also not update any links that depended on thepath of that file.)File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) may work, but are not officially supported at this time.Changes performed outside of Obsidian are not watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian willnot detect the change, update search indexes, etc.Symlinking things under the .obsidian/ directory in order to share them between vaults has a highchance of corrupting your settings, unless you really really know what you’re doing.If you decide to gothis way, at least have backups.

This is the version number that you’ll see in the [Title bar] and the[Vault switcher].You can have most of the new features and bug fixes by having an up-to-update current version.
However, forsome low-level updates, you might need to bring the [Installer version] up to date.Interface languageThe interface of Obsidian has been translated to various languages by [[Credits#Translators|our amazingvolunteer translators]]. You can change the interface language either in Settings → About or in the [Vaultswitcher].Don’t see your language in the list or seeing untranslated bits?Consider [[Contributing to Obsidian#Translatingthe docs|help us translate Obsidian into your language]].Installer versionIf you look closely in Settings -> About, you can find your current version and your installer version.Installer version will not increase when you [[Update Obsidian|auto-update]], unlike the [Current version].
Yourinstaller version will only increase when you install Obsidian with a new installer.To grab the latest installer, please go to our [official website].Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but to update the engine for certain new features Obsidian, weencourage you to grab the latest installer from our official website from time to time, when your current versionis above the installer version by a lot, for example when your current version is 0.10.8 while installer version is0.8.3.CustomizationCustom hotkeysMost hotkeys are customizable in Obsidian.We only defined default hotkeys for the most commonly used commands, but if you frequently use a command,it would save you lots of time if you add a hotkey for it.For a list of default hotkeys, [[Use hotkeys|see here]].Viewing hotkeys The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in [Command palette].
If there’s ahotkey listed for that command, it’s set.Setting hotkeysTo add a hotkey, remove a hotkey, or restore hotkeys to default, go to Settings => Hotkeys. Note that you canalso filter the list, as the list of commands is quite long.AppearanceBase themeObsidian comes with two base themes, light and dark.This option sets the default color scheme your theme willuse to either display its light or dark mode version.Custom themeThere are lots of community themes contributed by our amazing community that you can easily choose from.You can easily tweak it by adding [[Add custom styles#Use Themes and or CSS snippets|CSS snippets]].TranslucencyYou can make the window translucent by enabling this option in the settings appearance tab.Currently thisoption is only available for Windows and macOS.There is a known issue under Windows where dragging the window is extremely slow when translucency isenabled.This is due to a Windows bug.
A Github issue tracking the status of a fix can be found here:https://github.com/riverar/sample-win32-acrylicblur/issues/2How toWorking with backlinksBacklinks are one of the most powerful features of Obsidian. As a result, they can sometimes be a bit confusing,so here’s some things that might help.The Backlinks panel has two sections, Linked mentions and Unlinked mentions.![[Backlinks.png]]As you can see, from this document, there is currently one entry in each section.Under Linked mentions you cansee that I made a link to this document in the [Linked pane] note.But, you can also see under Unlinked mentionsthat I wrote the name of this note but did not make it a link.This can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you weremaking when you wrote them.
If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in yourfield, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships between ideas you might not have otherwise.If a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a Linkbutton. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, makingit into an explicit link.You can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under the More Options menu.This will be a[Linked pane] connected to the note, and can be moved around anywhere, as described in [Pane layout].There’salso an option to do this in the [Command palette].Add aliases to notealiases: alias, aliasesSometimes, you might want to refer to the same file with multiple names in different contexts.
These alternativenames are what we call “aliases” .For example, you might want to refer to your partner by their full name, first name, or a nickname. Or you mightwant to refer to “artificial intelligence” by its abbreviation “AI” .If you know multiple languages, you may want torefer to the same concept with their name in the same language that the rest of the note is written in.Set aliasesStarting in 0.9.16, you’re able to specify the “aliases” property in a note’s [YAML front matter] like so:aliases: [AI, Artificial Intelligence]---Please note that this section must be placed at the very top of a note to take effect.In the future, we’ll consider more user-friendly ways to manage aliases than manually writing them in frontmatter.Link with aliasesOnce you’ve set aliases for a file, you can write [[alias]] to link to the original page.
A redirect icon will showup in the auto-complete list like so:![[Insert alises.png]]An internal link with display text will get inserted like so: [[Add aliases to note|alias]] .Note: the link to alias is NOT inserted as [[alias]] for interoperability, so that other software can recognize itas well.Find unlinked mentions After you’ve set aliases for a note, you can find unlinked mentions by both its name and its aliases.For example, after setting “AI” as an alias for “Artificial intelligence” , you’ll see mentions of “AI” in other files inthe [Backlinks] section.If you decide to link this mention, a link with display text set to the alias will be created for you. Following theexample above, AI will become [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] once you click on the “Link” button.Change settingsThe settings can be found by clicking the gear in the bottom left corner, or by hitting Ctrl/Cmd-, .
Most ofthem are fairly self-explanatory, but here are some notes that might be helpful.Most of the settings are toggle switches. If there are more details to a setting, it may have a gear next tothe switch for additional settings.For example, the gear next to Spell Check reveals the custom dictionary,so you can remove words you may have accidentally added.Enabling plugins will cause their settings to appear in the list of tabs.For example, if you have the DailyNote plugin enabled, a setting tab will appear that allows you to further configure it.Working with multiple cursorsIf you hold down Alt ( option on mac) and click, you can create multiple cursors.
This can be useful whenmodifying a lot of lines in the same way, for example putting - at the beginning of multiple lines to turn theminto a list, or appending [[ to a series of links you’ve copied from elsewhere.To cancel multiple cursors, either click somewhere in the note (without a modifier key), or hit escape.FoldingFolding text is an extremely powerful tool for outlining or writing, in order to focus on what you’re working on.To use folding, go to Settings (the gear icon on the left) => Editor and turn on Fold indent and Foldheading .Obsidian has the ability to fold both markdown headers and indented lists. Note that at the top of this note thereis a downward pointing arrow next to the title.If clicked, it will fold the entire note up, and if clicked again, it willshow the note.This can be applied at multiple levels of markdown, as well as multiple levels of indentation inlists.By way of example1.Categories of things2.A subcategory3.Another subcategoryi.

It’s useful because Markdown can accept HTML, which is asimple language to construct the web pages we see every day.For example:<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnTvZWp5Q7o"></iframe>Produces: Making a Minecraft Obsidi … The basic syntax is:<iframe src="INSERT YOUR URL HERE"></iframe>Some websites have quirks that don’t allow you to embed them. For example, you can’t embed a YouTube videoby using its normal URL, but you can use its embed URL which is https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID .If you want to embed a website, try searching for “{website} embed iframe” .For example, you can embed Twitter tweets like so as suggested by search results:<iframeborder=0frameborder=0height=250width=550src="https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjack%2Fstatus%2F20"></iframe> Developer notesThe syntax is inspired by Markdown’s image syntax.We had two observations:1.[Image](link.png) links to the image, but ![Image](link.png) actually displays it.

The internal link syntax is based on this assumption: [[My page]] is a shortcut (or “syntactic sugar” ifyou will) for [My page](My page) .To combine these two things, we can come up with a third pattern: ![[My page]] should be equivalent to ![My page](My page) , which by the image convention, if the title is the same as the link, should display it.There are other implementations out there, for example Roam Research uses {{embed: ((NODE_ID))}} .
Wehave also considered using the ((Page name)) syntax too, but we feel like ![[Page name]] is moreconsistent, more familiar, and leaves more room so that the other symbols to have their own meanings.Resize imagesYou can resize images using the following syntax:For markdown images, use ![AltText|100x100](https://url/to/image.png) For embeds, use ![[image.png|100x100]] To have the image scale according to its aspect ratio, omit the height ![[image.png|100]] Import dataThere are a few differences between the way various PKM and note taking systems work that mean movingbetween them can be a little complicated. For the most part, if whatever you’re using can be converted tomarkdown, it will work fairly well within Obsidian.But some things, like tags and links, can be tricky.On our Forum there is a post collecting methods that other people have developed.

In a lot of cases, these will be the same, or at least a helpful place to start.Built-in tools From Roam ResearchIf you have data in Roam, it’s easy to export and play around with it in Obsidian.1.Choose “Export all” in the menu:![[Pasted image.png]]1.Click the blue “Export all” button:![[Pasted image 1.png]]1.Unzip the “Roam-Export-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.zip” into a folder.2.
Click on the vault icon (the tooltip should say “Open another vault”) on the bottom left corner in theapp, and select “Open folder as vault” .Pick the folder you just unzipped to.1. Use our [markdown format converter] to convert Roam Research’s Markdown format into Obsidian’sformat.It can be used turn #tag into Obsidian [[links]] .It can also convert ^^highlight^^ into ==highlight== .From BearIf you’re importing from Bear, the [Markdown format converter] plugin has an option to convert ::highlight:: to ==highlight== .Using ZettelkastenIf you’ve been using the Zettelkasten method to structure your notes, here’s something you might want to know:Links in Obsidian require a full match to the note name.
This means that [[202001010000]] will not properlylink to [[202001010000 My Note]] .In order to fix that, you can use our [markdown format converter] to convert your Zettelkasten links into either [[202001010000 My Note]] or [[202001010000 My Note|My Note]] .You might also be interested in the [Zettelkasten prefixer] plugin.Preview and edit modesIn obsidian, a document can be viewed in either edit mode or preview mode. In edit mode, you will see basicmarkdown rendering, but certain things, like code syntax highlighting and embedded files, will only show up inpreview mode.Most notably, any images you embed will only be visible in preview mode.To toggle between preview and edit mode, click the preview button in the title bar.In edit mode, it will appear asa page; in preview mode, a pencil.If you Cmd/Ctrl - click, the preview will be opened in a [Linked pane].
Youcan also toggle Preview Mode by hitting Cmd/Ctrl-E , but this hotkey can, of course, be changed.If you want to default to opening in preview rather than edit mode, a toggle for that can be found in the[Command palette]. You can also set a [[Use hotkeys|Keyboard Shortcut]] for toggling between default states.Working with tagsTags are a very useful way of grouping multiple notes so they are easy to find.A tag is essentially a clickablesearch through your entire Vault for a term.For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notesthat contain that tag.Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notesin or a type of idea.Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as “entry points” for thinking aboutconnected ideas.
But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like.Tag paneIf you have the [Tag pane] plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes,sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search.This will allow you to search exact matches of a tag.For example, when clicking , as per usual, but if you want tofind all instances of maintag with all subtags, you can still use the [Search] to look for #maintag .This isuseful in cases where you have subcategories of things but you also want to be able to easily find all instances ofthe higher category.Allowed charactersSpaces are not allowed in tags.So, if you want to have multiple words in a tag, you can use these formats:CamelCase: #TwoWordsUnderscore: #two_wordsDash: #two-wordsThe only symbols allowed are:1._ (underscore) and - (dash) to separate words;2.
/ (forward slash) for [[Tag pane#Nested tags|nested tags]].Numbers are allowed in the tag, ==as long as the tag is not purely numeric==. For example, #1984 does not forma valid tag, but #y1984 is valid.Working with multiple vaultsEach collection of notes in Obsidian is known as a Vault.A Vault consists of a folder, and any sub-folders withinit.Right now, you’re looking at the Obsidian Help Vault, which is just a folder of files included with Obsidian.You can open another Vault anywhere on your computer, and it will retain its own individual [[Coreplugins|Plugins]] and [[Add custom styles|custom styling]].
This is useful, for example, if you have one Vaultwhere you keep notes but a different one in which you do long-form writing.A new or existing Vault can be opened from the button just above the Settings gear.![[Vault picker.png]]You have the option to either open an existing folder of markdown files, create a new vault (which essentially justcreates a new folder that you will put markdown files into), or opening a special vault containing these help files.The Help Vault is stored in a special Obsidian directory (see [How Obsidian stores data]), but aside from that, it’sa directory of files just like any other.[[Internal link|Internal Links]] are not shared across Vaults. If you have one Vault inside another Vault, this can getconfusing, so we recommend not doing that.Always remember, a Vault is just a collection of markdown files.
You can use whatever file managementtechniques you would normally to move them around on your file system, and Obsidian will automatically refreshto keep up.Transfer settings between vaultsAll settings, themes, and plugins are stored in the .obsidian folder under your vault. If you copy this folderfrom one vault to another, all the settings will be transferred as well.You may need to restart Obsidian for all ofthe settings to take effect.This folder is hidden in some operating systems.Notably, you can use Cmd-Shift-Period to show hidden fileson macOS in order to reveal the .obsidian folder.Link to blocksIn Obsidian 0.9.5 or higher, in addition to [[Internal link#Link to headings|linking to headings]], you can also linkto blocks.What is a blockA “block” can be a paragraph, a blockquote, a list item, etc.In general, anything that has empty lines before andafter is a block.
^dcf64cLink to blocksTo link to a block in a specific file, first type [[filename to bring up a list of matched files. After selecting afile, type ^ and continue typing to search for blocks to link to.Once you hit enter, a link to that block will be generated for you, in the format similar to [[filename#^dcf64c]] , where dcf64c is the block ID that was just generated for you.If you’re not sure which file the block is in, another method is to type [[^^ and search for blocks in all files.This will search through all the blocks in your vault, so expect a bit of delay if your vault is large.For example, [[#^dcf64c]] is a link to a block above.Embed or transclude blocksSimilar to [[Embed files|files embeds]], you can simply use !in front of a block link to embed it.Here’s an example:![[#^dcf64c]]Manual block IDsIf you want human readable block IDs, you can manually put ^your-id after a block.
Make sure there’s at leastone space if you’re putting the ID at end of a line.To refer to complex blocks like tables, put the block ID on its own after the block, and make sure there is anempty line both before and after the block ID.After you add the block ID manually, when you refer to that block, your-id will be used instead of a randomlygenerated block ID.Note that only letters, numbers, and dashes are allowed in manual block IDs.InteroperabilityPlease be aware that block reference is not part of standard Markdown, but rather Obsidian’s specific flavor ofMarkdown. That means these links will not work outside of Obsidian.You can still find referenced block by searching for the block ID, although that’s a rather manual process.Theconnection is not lost as long as you have software that can search in a folder.Capture informationCopy and pasteWhen you see something useful online, you can simply select the text, copy, and paste in Obsidian.
Obsidian willtry to convert it into proper Markdown so that it fits right in.If you only wish to copy the text without the formatting, please use Ctrl-Shift-V on Windows and Linux and Cmd-Shift-V on macOS to do so.Use a clipper extensionBecause Obsidian accepts any Markdown file, you can clip entire web pages by clipping to Markdown files anddownloading them into your vault.death_au’s “MarkDownload” browser extension works well for this purpose. You can get it for:Google Chrome FirefoxMicrosoft EdgeManage attachmentsAdd an attachmentThere are several ways to include attachments in your notes:1.Copy and paste;2.Drag and drop;3.
Download or copy file to vault folder.After being added, these attachment files are just normal files and can still be accessed through your file system.Please note that only [Accepted file formats] are handled.Copy and pastePasting a local file from your system explorer or your clipboard will put the file into your vault.This is very handy when combined with screenshot tools.Drag and dropIf you drag and drop a file from your file explorer, it will be copied to your vault as well.Download or copy to vault folderThis can work well when paired with [[Capture information#Use a clipper extension|clipper extensions]].You can also download images from your browser into your vault folder directly for later reference.Change default attachment locationBy default, new attachments will be dropped in the root of your vault.
You can fine tune this setting in Settings=> Files & Links => “Default location for new attachments” .Choose a folderYou can choose a fixed folder to always place your attachments in. To do this, choose “In the folder specifiedbelow” , and choose a folder in your vault in the new field that appears.Alternatively, you can right click on a folder in [File explorer] and choose “Set as attachment folder” .Same folder as current fileSometimes, you may want the attachment files to always be in the same folder as the note you’re working on.Inthis case, choose “Same folder as current file” .Under the current folderYou can also choose to save attachments to a folder underneath the folder that the current file is in.To do this, choose the “Subfolder under current folder ” option, and write the name of the subfolder in the fieldthat appears.
For example, if you write assets , and your note is in VAULT/folder/path/ , the attachmentswill be added to VAULT/folder/path/assets when you’re working on this note.You don’t need to create the subfolder beforehand; if it doesn’t exist, Obsidian will create it for you.Add custom stylesWhen you want to add custom styles to your vault, there are two main ways to do this:Vault stylesThemesThemes allow you to toggle the appearance of your vault with a dropdown menu once they have been added toyour vault’s theme directory.This configuration can be found in Settings => Appearance => Themes section of your vault settings.Create a custom themeIf you are creating your own theme, you can do this by:1. Creating your custom theme CSS file in the themes directory YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/themes/YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME.css 2.
Enabling it in the theme dropdown under Settings => Appearance => Themes For more information on how to customize styles of the graph, you can find more information in [Graph view].Use Themes and/or CSS snippetsYou can find this configuration in Settings => Appearance . You can choose a community theme or set thetheme you developed yourself.If you set a community theme, it will be automatically placed in the correct folder.If you develop your own theme, you have to put it in the shown folder location yourself.CSS snippets are supposed to be small pieces of CSS for small changes you want to make/things you want toadd.These snippets have to be placed in the shown directory.You can go to the respective directories by clicking on the folder buttons.
If the folder isn’t created yet, it will be.In case your snippets or theme don’t show up after you’ve put them there, you can click the button next to thefolder icon to refresh the list.Obsidian Publish stylesAt this time, [Obsidian Publish] is unable to automatically detect the vault’s configured [[Add customstyles#Themes|theme]] and publish the respective styles.A workaround for this limitation is to:1. Go into YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/themes/CURRENT_THEME_FOLDER ;2.Copy the primary CSS file CURRENT_THEME.css in the folder;3.Paste it in the root directory of your vault ( YOUR_VAULT );4.Rename the CSS file as publish.css ;5.In the publish plugin, upload the publish.css file;6.If your CSS doesn’t take effect in a few minutes, try refreshing the browser cache as the stale CSS mighthave been cached.Basic note takingIf you’ve just opened Obsidian, you’ll see two documents here.The one in the left pane is a text file, which youcan edit using Markdown syntax.
The one in the right pane is a Preview of the same text file if you were to exportit as HTML, or as a PDF document. Note that some things look different in Preview, and, most obviously, links arenot in brackets.To follow a link, click on it in the Preview pane.You can follow links in the Editor pane as well, byholding down Ctrl/Cmd and clicking on the link.If you want to go back to the page you were on before, use theshortcut Ctrl/Cmd-alt-LeftArrow Alternatively, the notes that link to the one you’re currently on will be shown in the Backlinks Panel on the right(find more about Backlinks [[Backlinks|here.]])If you get lost at any time, or just want to explore what else Obsidian can do, Ctrl/Cmd-P brings up theCommand Palette.You can type commands there, like “Navigate back” , and you’ll see options filter to a short list,along with hotkey shortcuts if they have them.At base, Obsidian is a tool for working with a bunch of markdown files that are stored on your computer.
If you’renot familiar with markdown, it’s just plain text with some formatting that makes it powerful (for more on that, see[[Format your notes|Markdown]]) . As a result, if you want to use obsidian for keeping regular notes on just aboutanything, it will work great.Let’s say you want to write a note about your favorite band.Just type the name of the note surrounded by twosquare brackets, like [[My Favorite Band]] Try it here (make sure you’re typing in the Editor pane): You’ll notice that the text and the brackets turn blue.That means it’s a link now.Click on that link in the Preview(or Cmd-click in the Editor), and you’ll see a blank note.Write whatever you want there, and when you’redone, come back here with Cmd-alt-left , or by clicking the name of this note ([Basic note taking]) in theBacklinks to the right.To learn more about navigating links, see [Internal link].Notice that your new note showed up automatically in the File Explorer to the left.
Obsidian automatically createsfiles when you click a link to a file that does not exist. This means you can [[write naturally]] about [[whatever comes to mind]] and then go back and create the new notes at your leisure.This makesObsidian a fantastic tool for thinking freely in notes without having to worry about where to file them.And if youdecide that a title is not what you actually meant, you can change the file name at the top of this window, andObsidian will automatically update all links to it.From there, you can make any kind of structure you want.Many people will want to make a Table ofContents note for listing major groups of notes.You can also use #tags to create categories (if you click that itwill show you every note that contains #tags ).Really, the structure you build should be whatever works for you.We suggest you just start with what feels natural.Obsidian is flexible enough that it should be relatively simple torearrange things later.Be aware!
The note you just created is in these Help documents, which will be overwritten on new releases. ==Ifyou created anything you care to keep, it should be put into a different vault==.For details on how to do that, see[Working with multiple vaults].If you want an example of a more advanced technique, you might look into the sample workflows on our forum.Update ObsidianHow auto-update worksObsidian checks for update every 12 hours.Once an update is available, restarting the app will automaticallybring you to the latest version.You can check your current version, check for updates in Settings => About.
You can also turn off “automaticupdates” there.Insider buildIf you’re looking to update to the latest insider build, please refer to [[Insider builds#How to enable insiderbuild|this guide]] on how to turn it on.Current version vs installed versionIf you look closely in Settings => About, you can find your current version and your installer version.Your current version is your Obsidian version. This is the version of the app on top of the engine (which isElectron).It will increase when you auto-update, but your installer version will not.Your installer version will onlyincrease when you install Obsidian with a new installer.
Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but to update the engine for certain new features Obsidian, weencourage you to grab the latest installer from our official website from time to time, when your current versionis above the installer version by a lot, for example when your current version is 0.10.8 while installer version is0.8.3.Format your notesObsidian is a Markdown-based note-taking and knowledge base app.We currently support the formats below:Internal linkingLink to a page: [[Internal link]].Link to a page: [Internal link].EmbedsEmbed another file (read more about [Embed files]).

Obsidian supports linking to notes in Mermaid:```mermaidgraph TDBiology –> Chemistryclass Biology,Chemistry internal-link;```An easier way to do it is the following: ^376b9d```mermaidgraph TDA[Biology]B[Chemistry]A –> Bclass A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;```This way, all the note names (at least until Z[note name] ) are all automatically assigned the class internal-link when you use this snippet.If you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes. "⨳ special character" It looks like this if you follow the [[Format your notes#^376b9d|second option]]: A["⨳ special character"] Developer notes We strive for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats, therefore we use a slightly unorthodoxcombination of flavors of markdown.

This will prompt you with the list of notes you can link to.Use Uparrow and Down arrow to navigate the suggestion list and Enter to select the current highlighted link.Link to headingsYou can also link to specific headers in files.Start typing a link like you would normally.When the note you wantis highlighted, press # instead of Enter and you’ll see a list of headings in that file.
Continue typing ornavigate with arrow keys as before, press # again at each subheading you want to add, and Enter tocomplete the link.To make the link display different text than its real note name in Preview, use the vertical pipe ( Shift+| ) Forexample: [[Internal link|Custom Link Name in Preview!]] This can be combined with linking to headers, as in[[Folding#By way of example|Example of Folding]].Following LinksTo follow a link in the Preview pane, simply click on the link.To follow a link in a new panel from Preview, click while pressing Ctrl/Cmd ’’To follow a link in the Editor pane, click the link while pressing Ctrl/Cmd .To follow a link in a new panel from the Editor, click the link while pressing Ctrl/Cmd-Shift ’’To see a preview of the linked content without leaving the current note, enable the [page preview] pluginand a popup window will be displayed.Working with multiple notesYou can edit and view multiple files in Obsidian.To effectively use split view, you only need to know a few things:1.
==Use Ctrl/Cmd key== when you want to open things in a new pane.By default, when you click something, it will open in the active pane. The active pane is marked with highlightedbar under the title, and its title is more visible than the inactive panes.To open files in new panes, hold down Ctrl/Cmd while you click in Preview mode ( Shift + Ctrl/Cmd in Editmode).This applies to a number of places, including [file explorer], [backlinks] (both links and unlinkedmentions), [search] results, and [graph view].It also applies to buttons; instead of previewing in the currentpane, you can Cmd+click the preview button to preview in a new pane.When using the Quick Switcher,holding down Cmd/Ctrl when hitting Enter will open in a new pane.2.You can also create new panes by ==splitting==.To create other layouts, you can split the current pane in half either horizontally or vertically.
Do this with themenu at the top right of the pane, use the command palette, or set a [Use hotkeys].![[Pasted image 16.png]]3. If you want a sticky pane that does not get replaced even when it’s active, ==pin it==.This is great if you’re working on something and want to use the other panes as temporary reference panes.Pinit to make sure it never gets replaced.![[Pasted image 17.png]]Pinned panes will have a highlighted pin icon instead of a grey one.4.Use ==linked panes== for previewing.When creating [[Linked pane|linked panes]], Ctrl/Cmd+click the preview or edit button when a Markdown fileis open.When linked to another pane, the panes’ scroll position will be synced, and if you open a file in one pane, theother pane will open the same file.[[Linked pane|Linked panes]] will be marked with a link icon.
You can hover the link to see which pane it’s linkedto, or click the icon to release it, so that they are no longer linked.For more information see [[Linked pane|linked panes]].![[Pasted image 18.png]]5. Panes can be ==rearranged by dragging==.Grab the icon in the upper left corner to arrange them however you need.For detailed information, see [Panelayout].Useful tips:1.You can resize the panes however you want, by dragging the resize handle that’s between each pane.2.Your file layout, including their sizes, will be remembered when you close the app, so don’t worry abouthaving to set them up every time you open the app!
Rename notesIf you’re already editing the note, you can rename it simply by editing the text in the title:![[Pasted image 6.png]]If you want to rename a note that you’re not editing, go to [file explorer], right-click on the note or folder andchoose “Rename”:![[Pasted image 7.png]]An even faster way is to press F2 while your mouse is over a note, which will take you straight to the renamingfunction.Create notesNotes are created in a few ways, depending on your workflow:1. Note-first approach.If you need to create a note, you can do so in [File explorer].The keyboard shortcutis Ctrl/Cmd+N .Also, if you have the [Command palette] plugin enabled (it’s on by default), press Ctrl/Cmd-p and type ‘new’ , then select **********2.Link-first approach.If you like to freely create notes, just use an [Internal link] to link to any note name (itdoesn’t need to exist at the time of creating the link).To write in the newly created note, simply click onthe link name.
It will be automatically created in your Vault and ready to type!![[Pasted image 3.png]]After creating it, the note title will appear in the internal link auto-completion, so you don’t need to type out thenote name every time. When you type [[ a popup will come up showing all the notes in your vault.Just typeuntil you see the one you want, and hit Return or click on it, and the name will be automatically filled in.If you already have folders set up in [File explorer], you can right-click on a folder to create notes inside it:![[Pasted image 4.png]]There are also buttons at the top of the file explorer for creating new notes or folders.Obsidian automatically saves your note two seconds after you stop typing, or if you close a pane.You can alsomanually save at any time by typing Ctrl/Cmd-S Related:[Rename notes]Licenses & add-on servicesCommercial license About Obsidian commercial licenseObsidian is free for personal use.

You can alsocontribute multiple times at any time.You can find this option at the bottom of the page in your Obsidian account page after logging in.Special thanks to the VIPs who proposed this “feature” to support Obsidian even more.==Contributing to Obsidian Unlimited does not let you give any additional features or benefits.== For this reason,we recommend upgrading to [Catalyst license] first, if you’re looking to access [Insider builds] or get coolbadges in our community.Note: we’ve set the minimal amount to $5 (so that processing fees would make sense).Obsidian SyncObsidian Sync™ is a paid service to sync notes between vaults on various devices.How Obsidian Sync worksObsidian Sync is fairly simple: once you hook up local vaults from multiple devices to the same remote vault,changes will be automatically synced between these local vaults, except for files and folders you instructObsidian to ignore.FeaturesCurrently, Obsidian Sync features:End-to-end encryption.Version history integrated into Obsidian.View & restore deleted files.Synchronize settings, themes, CSS snippets, plugins, and plugin settings.
Selective sync.Exclude certain folders.Toggle syncing for images, audio, video, PDF, and unsupported files.Switch between multiple remote vaults.In the future, we’ll improve Obsidian Sync with:Vault sharingEnable Obsidian Sync pluginYou can enable Obsidian Sync by enabling the “Sync” plugin under Settings => Core plugins.Setting up remote vaultsWarning: We do not recommend using third party sync services to sync the same vault with Obsidian Sync.[[#Third party sync|More about this later]].To start syncing, first you need to create a remote vault that stores your encrypted data.To do that, go to Setting => Sync => Pick remote vault => Choose => Create new vault.After creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the “Connect” button next to it.You can choose to either start syncing immediately after connecting, or choose folders to ignore.Set encryption passwordBy default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault.
This password is used to encrypt and decryptyour data and is extremely important.You’ll be asked for the password any time you setup sync with an encrypted vault. ==If you forget or lose thepassword, your data will remain encrypted and unusable forever.We are unable to recover your password or anyencrypted data for you.== Your local files are not affected.You can also choose to turn off the “Custom end-to-end password” option to leave managing the encryption keyto us.This is still fairly secure and provides the convenience of not having to remember a password.Check sync statusAfter connecting to a remote vault, you can check the current sync status in the bottom status bar.You canhover over the status icon to read more about what’s going on.Clicking on the status icon will open up sync settings as a shortcut.Version history As you edit your notes, versions are saved approximately every 10 seconds.
==Version history is only availablefor notes, not attachments.==You can right click a file in the file explorer pane to see its version history. This option is also available in the moreoptions menu.After selecting a version in the left column in the version history screen, you can restore the file to this version byclicking on the “Restore” button.Deleted filesAfter you delete a file, you can view it in Setting => Sync => Deleted files => View.Clicking on a deleted file will open its version history.You can then choose to restore the file back to a previousversion.Selective syncYou can selectively sync files by folder or file type.==Selective sync only applies to future changes.Any filesthat have already been uploaded will not be deleted even if you choose to ignore them.
Please be sure toconfigure it before starting the sync process.==Exclude foldersYou can uncheck folders in Settings => Sync => Excluded folders => Manage to prevent them from gettingsynced.Excluded folders will be ignored when both uploading and download changes.File typesYou can toggle sync for images, audio, video, PDFs, and unsupported files under Settings => Sync => Selectivesync.Synchronizing settingsIn addition to your notes and attachments, Obsidian Sync offers individual toggles to synchronize these files:The main app settings, including editor settings, files & links settings, etc.Appearance settings, including dark mode, selected theme, and enabled snippets.Themes and snippets that has been downloaded.Hotkeys.Which [Core plugins] are enabled.Core plugin settings.Which community plugins are enabled.
Downloaded/installed community plugins, and their settings.You can choose which ones to synchronize with your remote vault to best suite your use case of Obsidian.Keep in mind that Obsidian does not apply your settings until you restart the application, or reload the vault. Thisnormally isn’t a problem on mobile since the app restarts often, but you may notice that settings you set on onedesktop device is “synced” to another device, but doesn’t take effect until the next restart.Sync will respect your selection of the settings folder override in case you’ve set it to a folder other than .obsidian .You can take advantage of this to create different profiles in your remote vault to sync yoursettings.
A common use case, for example, is to use a different profile for mobile devices vs desktop devices.Settings version historyIf something goes wrong, and you lost some of your settings, you can always revert the affected settings filethrough the “Settings version history” section in Sync.Third party syncIf you are using Obsidian Sync, we do not recommend using third party sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive,OneDrive, or iCloud to sync the same vault between the same devices using Obsidian Sync.
Doing so may causeconflicts, duplicate files, or in the worst case, could lead to corrupted files.If you do setup Obsidian Sync and a third party sync service to sync a vault between two devices, then thefollowing will happen:If Obsidian Sync “wins” the race and syncs your file first, then your third party sync service will generate a“conflicted copy”.If your third party sync service “wins” the race and syncs your file first, then Obsidian Sync will attempt tomerge the two slightly different versions, often causing the last few characters you just typed to be rolledback.If you wish to maintain a backup of your vault using a third party sync service, you can still do so by setting upyour sync provider on your primary single device, but not on your secondary devices.
This will ensure that yourthird party sync service does not “race” with Obsidian Sync.FAQWhat is end-to-end encryption?End-to-end encryption means the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only bedecrypted using your encryption key once it’s back on one of your devices.We do not have the capability of reading your data, nor do any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internetservice provider.In the rare case of a complete server breach, your data will remain encrypted, and nobody will have the ability todecrypt your files without knowing your password.
How many remote vaults can I have?Each account with Obsidian Sync can have up to 5 remote vaults.How long is version history kept?Version histories are kept for up to one year before we clean it up.How large can each remote vault be?At the moment, each remote vault can have up to 4 GB of data, including version history.Is my data encrypted on my hard disk?No, your data is still in plain text on your hard disk.
If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer,you should look for a disk encryption solution.How long is my data kept after my subscription expires?Data in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscriptionexpires.As long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage.Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution?Obsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service.With version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additionalbackup measures.Obsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugsand glitches.Should I pick my own encryption password?Pick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy.
This guarantees that anyone whodoesn’t know your password will never be able to read your notes.Letting us manage your encryption key is more convenient, and you do not risk forgetting or losing yourpassword.Your local vault is not affected by this option. If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problemfor you.Is the end-to-end encryption strong?We use industry-standard AES–256 to encrypt your data.AES–256 is a military-grade encryption specificationthat is widely used in online banking.Here are the technical details for those interested: Key derivation function used: scrypt with saltEncryption algorithm used: AES–256 using GCMWhat does the vault limit exceeded error mean?Each vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb.This error indicates your vault has exceeded thatlimit in size.
Don’t forget: attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your4gb limit even if your vault’s actual size is less than 4gb.If you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault. Go to the Obsidian Syncsettings in Preferences => Sync and look for the “Vault size over limit” options.Obsidian PublishObsidian Publish™ is a paid hosting service for your notes.For instructions on how to publish your notes from within the Obsidian app, refer to the [[Publish|Publishplugin]].PrivacyYou have total control over what to publish via the [[Publish|Publish plugin]] - either your entire vault or justselected notes within your vault.As for any notes you choose not to publish, you can be confident that thosenotes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them.Backing upPlease note that Obsidian Publish is not to be used as a backup for your content.
Make sure you always have apersonal backup copy of your site using your preferred backup method. Our efforts on Obsidian Publish will bemore focused on functionality, ease of use, and site availability.DemoThere’s a good chance that you’re already viewing this article on our official site powered by Obsidian Publish.If not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help.What’s includedThe Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing thenotes you want to publish.To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable linelength and full page length.There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[Publish|Publish plugin]].Changes tothese options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes.
NavigationEnabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them.Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate.Search barAdds a search bar to page. This bar can be used to search for pages, aliases, and headings within pages.It doesnot currently search through the full text content of the site.Graph viewDisplays a local graph of the page currently open.This uses the same rendering engine as the [Graph view]plugin in Obsidian.Table of contentsDisplays a table of contents for the page currently open.The list is generated from headings within the page,similar to the [Outline] plugin.Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted asthey scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it.BacklinksDisplays a section at the end of each page called “Linked to this page” , containing backlinks from other pages.
Ifthere are no backlinks, the section will not be displayed.TagsWhen the reader clicks on a tag, they can see a list of other pages that includes the same tag.Hover previewWhen hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [Pagepreview] plugin in Obsidian.Custom CSSTo customize the styling of your site, you can upload a publish.css .This file must be stored in the root folderof your site.You can use your existing theme and add some extra tweaks for publish in publish.css .FaviconTo change the favicon of your site, you can upload png icons of any size in the format of favicon-32.png or favicon-32x32.png .You can also upload the file favicon.ico .These files can be stored in any folder.
Thecurrent recommendation (as of 2020) is to provide sizes 32×32 , 128x128 , 152×152 , 167x167 , 180x180 , 192x192 , and 196x196 .Custom JS If you wish to execute your own JavaScript code to change the visitor experience, or add various integrations likeDiscus!, Discourse, etc. you can do so by uploading publish.js inside the root of your vault.Note that thesescripts will only run for visitors to your custom domain.Disallow search engine indexingThis option adds a meta noindex tag to all your pages so search engines like Google does not index your site.Note that search engines won’t be able to index your site anyway if it’s password protected.Google AnalyticsIf you wish to setup Google Analytics for your site, first make sure your local laws and regulations allows.Then,you just need to put the tracking code, in the form of UA-XXXXX-Y into the text box and your site willautomatically track page views.
Note that Google Analytics is only available to visitors from your custom domain.When testing Google Analytics, please make sure to disable any ad-blocking browser extensions like uBlockOrigin which blocks Google Analytics scripts from running.Also, Obsidian Publish isn’t directly compatible with Google Tag Manager at the moment - you can set it up usingcustom javascript if you wish to use Google Tag Manager instead of Google Analytics.Custom domainYou can setup a custom domain or subdomain for your Obsidian Publish site. Currently, we don’t yet have a wayto provision SSL certificate on your behalf, so you need to resort to either an SSL-enabled server of your own, orto setup your site on CloudFlare, which provides SSL for free.You can also setup Obsidian Publish as a sub-URL of a site you own.For example, https://mysite.com/my-notes/ .
To achieve this, you must host your own server and proxy all requests to our server at https://publish.obsidian.md/ .Continue reading for setup details.CloudFlare setupThe easiest way to setup a custom domain or subdomain is by making an account with CloudFlare and lettingCloudFlare manage your domain. This allows you to add SSL to your site for free, as well as ensure your site isfast wherever in the world it’s accessed from.Typically users will host their Obsidian Publish content on a rootdomain (e.g.mysite.com ) or an immediate subdomain (e.g.notes.mysite.com ).These instructions workfor both cases.1.Open Cloudflare to the domain you wish to add Publish to (e.g.mysite.com , even if you want asubdomain like notes.mysite.com ).2.Go to DNS and click Add Record.Select CNAME, and in ‘name’ enter the domain or subdomain you wish(e.g.notes.mysite.com ).In ‘target’ , enter the value publish-main.obsidian.md .
Do not includeyour personal sub-URL in this value, as Obsidian Publish handles this from your configuration.3. Go to SSL/TLS and set the SSL/TLS encryption mode to Full .This will configure the SSL/TLS certificateautomatically.Once you are done with configuring CloudFlare, you can head to your site options in Obsidian, and set the URL toyour domain or subdomain.
This allows our server to associate the domain to your site.Troubleshooting: If your custom domain setup ends up in a redirect loop, it’s likely that the encryption mode inCloudFlare to Flexible instead of Full .If you wish to configure both mysite.com and www.mysite.com to Obsidian Publish, you will need to createa Page Rule as follows:- URL match: www.mysite.com/* - Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect- Redirect URL: https://mysite.com/$1 Once you create the page rule, you should also create a CNAME record for www.mysite.com just like youcreated for mysite.com Proxy/redirect setupIf you wish to host your own web server and setup your own SSL encryption, you can choose this option.
If youare already hosting a website under your domain or subdomain, you can also use this option and setup yourwebsite to load your Obsidian Publish site under a specific URL path, instead of hosting the full site.Simply proxy all requests under that URL path to https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/... and configure the site options in Obsidian to the same URL path bysetting Custom URL to mysite.com/my-notes .NGINXlocation /my-notes { proxy_pass https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/; proxy_ssl_server_name on;}ApacheAdd to .htaccess :Note: mod_rewrite must be enabled, and you may also need to configure SSLProxyEngineNetlify[[redirects]] from = "https://mysite.com/my-notes/*" to = "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:splat" status = 200 force = trueRewriteEngine onRewriteRule "^my-notes/(.*)$" "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/$1" [L,P] VercelIn vercel.json configure rewrites:{ ...

This is due to the cross-domain security restrictions thatare imposed by modern browsers.
The good news is that readers of your site should never run into issue this ifyou only let visitors use your custom domain.Redirect old site to custom domainIf you’d like to redirect your visitors from the old publish.obsidian.md site to your new custom domain, thereis an option you can enable in the custom domain settings page which will do just that.Coming upObsidian Publish is still in its early days. Here are some features we plan to add:Full custom domain support (with SSL certificate provisioning).Full text search.More built-in themes.Please let us know if you have any Obsidian Publish feature requests by submitting a forum request here.PricingFor the pricing of Obsidian Publish, please visit our pricing page.Technical detailsObsidian Publish uses Cloudflare as the CDN (content delivery network) to distribute your site across the globefor a faster access.
This involves caching copies of the files of your site on some of the 200+ data centers toensure the lowest latency for your readers and the site remain speedy and loads fast even if your viewer lives faraway from our primary servers.However, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitorsmight not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour beforeit has to be “re-validated” to ensure the content hasn’t changed.If you’ve just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a “hard refresh”by holding the reload button and choosing “Hard reload” in the dropdown menu.Failing that, you can try clearingthe browser cache or disabling cache using the developer tools in the network tab.Hosting media filesWhile Obsidian Publish allows you to upload video clips, it is not optimized for video delivery.
As such, yourvisitors may find that the videos on your site may not deliver a great experience.We recommend using a proper video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos for ObsidianPublish.
The advantages of using a proper video hosting site includes:- Automatic re-encoding ensures that your videos can be played on all mobile devices regardless of whatencoding format you used in your original file.- Dynamic quality adjustment based on bandwidth availability and ensures that videos can be played smoothlywithout constantly pausing for “buffering” .- High efficiency video compression to ensure that visitors don’t blow through their data cap when viewing yoursite.- Global CDN allowing your videos to be loaded fast regardless of where your visitor is located in the world.RelatedRefer to the [[Publish|Publish plugin]] for details on publishing your notes.Refund policyObsidian Catalyst and Unlimited[Catalyst license] purchases and Obsidian Unlimited donations are to support Obsidian’s development.

These vaults can be found in your iCloud Drive folder,under an app folder named “Obsidian” that shows the Obsidian logo.If you choose not to use iCloud for a vault, then it will be stored in the sandboxed file system of the Obsidian app.The local vaults are accessible from any other apps that support picking a folder from the file system.
As such,apps like Working Copy can be used to sync with Obsidian’s local vaults.==Be aware that if you choose to store your vault locally, they will be automatically deleted by iOS when youuninstall Obsidian’s app.==SyncQuick startIf you already have a vault on your desktop, here’s the two ways to sync your vault to mobile and access it:[[#iCloud Drive Sync]][[#Obsidian Sync]] The two current officially supported sync solutions are iCloud and Obsidian Sync.Working Copy (git) is another alternative that has been tested to work with Obsidian on iOS.Currently, there is no known support for the following sync services on iOS yet:- Dropbox- Google Drive- OneDrive- SyncthingIf you find out a way to sync using these services on iOS with Obsidian, we would be glad if you can join ourDiscord server and teach us how to set it up.In theory, any third party sync providers that can provide background-sync for a specific folder on your deviceshould be able to work, but we are not aware of any other than Working Copy.
This is due to the limitations of thehighly complex mechanism of cross-app file sharing in iOS, unlike Android which allows easy cross-app filesharing. Because of this, most third party sync providers don’t have a proper implementation for backgroundsync on iOS.Currently Obsidian does not support third party sync providers that expose a virtual file system throughFileProvider.We will be attempting this in the future as an improvement.Obsidian SyncYou can follow the same steps as Android’s sync as shown below, making sure that you create a non-iCloudfolder as we do not recommend using both Obsidian Sync and iCloud Sync concurrently, which has beenreported to cause data loss due to [[Obsidian Sync#Third party sync|race conditions]].![[Android app#Obsidian Sync]]iCloud Drive SyncTo setup a new synced vault through iCloud Drive:1.Start the iOS app and choose “Create a new vault”;2.
On desktop, using the “Open another vault” option, point to the new vault location in iCloud.To setup an existing vault to be synced through iCloud Drive:1. Start the app and choose “Create a new vault”;2.Name it the same as your desktop vault to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work;3.Wait for iCloud to sync this empty folder to your desktop;4.Copy and paste everything under your vault to this empty folder, this will now be your synced folderlocation;5.On desktop, using the “Open another vault” option, point to the new vault location in iCloud;6.Wait for iCloud to sync everything to your mobile device.Working CopyYou can alternatively setup Working Copy to use Git to sync your vault on iOS.To do this, you should create anempty local vault on your device first, then you can “Setup Folder Sync” and select a local vault inside theObsidian app.
Then, you can manually commit & push.Third party sync supportMany users asks why Obsidian for Mobile doesn’t support their preferred sync solution. Here’s a briefexplanation on the current state of mobile sync support.The thing about Obsidian that’s different from other apps like 1Writer and iA Writer is that Obsidian works on topof a vault rather than a single note.Many of the core Obsidian functionality depend on the whole vault and all thefiles inside, such as the link auto-complete, image embedding, tag pane, backlinks, and all the cross-notefunctionality.In contrast, most Markdown editing apps simply “open” a single note, let the user perform edits, then save thenote back.
Because of this, the OS and third party sync providers typically only provide an API foraccessing/working with a single file, but not so much for working with a vault (folder of files with potentiallysubfolders).For sync, a regular markdown editor app can simply implement the basic “download file when you open aselected file” and “upload the file back when you press save” . Obsidian has to download the whole vault to beuseful, and keep track of all the modified files (like for example, when you perform a file rename, we mightupdate a bunch of other files for links that has changed due to the rename).
On top of that, we need a way tomonitor for changes through the sync solution to be able to update our internal caches when files change, toprovide accurate links.Keeping all that in sync with a third party sync provider would be quite tedious - and this is actually part of thereason why most sync providers don’t make a proper sync client for mobile and you have to use a third party app(like DropSync or FolderSync) to do it. Unfortunately, such apps don’t exist on iOS because of app sandboxing.Known issuesiCloud folder on macOSIf you find yourself unable to drag & drop things into the iCloud folder in Finder on macOS, please download thelatest Obsidian Desktop release from https://obsidian.md as it contains a fix for this issue.Once it’s installed,running the app should automatically cause iCloud to update the folder permissions.
If this does not work rightaway, you may need to restart your machine.Paste menu sometimes not appearingSome users runs into an issue where tapping on the cursor does not show the paste menu. As a workaround, youcan use the three-finger tap gesture to trigger a global edit menu which can be used to paste into the text.Mobile app beta Public releaseThe mobile apps are now officially publicly available.
You can find the download links for the public versions athttps://obsidian.md/mobileDocumentationFor more details on how to use Obsidian for Mobile, including guides for setting up sync, see [Obsidian Mobile].Insider buildsIf you’re a holder of the [Catalyst license], you may wish to join our [[Insider builds|insider builds]] for mobile.To keep feedback and releases centralized as we don’t have the capacity to debug and collect feedback viaemail, we ask Catalyst users who would like to beta test to go through the following steps:Step 1: join our DiscordFirst of all, please join our Discord.Step 2: claim your Catalyst badge to access #insider-build-mobile channelIf you don’t have your badge yet, [[Catalyst license#Discord badge|you can get it in your Account page]].Step 3: get the app via TestFlight (iOS) or APK (Android)Once you get your badge, you should be able to see the #insider-build-mobile channel along with regularchannels like #general and #publish .To find the instructions for installing the mobile apps, go to #insider-build-mobile , and open pinnedmessages.On Discord web and desktop, you can open pinned messages of a channel by clicking on the pushpin icon nearthe search bar at the top.

Make sure to open the link on your iPhone or iPad, rather than onyour computer.For the Android app, install the APK from the latest pinned messages if there are several of them.How do I provide feedback?Before reporting an issue or submitting a feature request, please visit the list of known issues on our forum tosee what’s already known and on the roadmap.The current group being rolled out can access the #insider-build-mobile channel on Discord as well as thenew Mobile category on the forum.To keep track of bug reports and feature requests, please direct them to the forum as usual.
Thank you for tryingout our beta!Android appThe Android app is now publicly available, and a link to the Play store listing can be found athttps://obsidian.md/mobileWhere are my vaults stored?On Android, the Obsidian home folder is stored in the public documents folder under Documents/Obsidian .The public Documents folder is typically stored in SD card or emulated storage.Any folder in this home folder will be considered a vault. If you sync or copy a vault folder into this directory, itcan be recognized when you open Obsidian.SyncOn Android, you may choose to use [Obsidian Sync] to synchronize your files, or use any third party syncprovider that can perform sync in the background.Obsidian SyncAs with Obsidian desktop, we provide our built-in paid [Obsidian Sync] service.To setup a synced vault through Obsidian Sync, first create a new empty local vault.
You should name it thesame as your desktop app to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work.Once the empty vault is open, open the left sidebar, tap the settings button, and setup Obsidian Sync just likeyou did on Desktop:1. Login to your Obsidian account in the Account tab.2.Enable the Sync core plugin.3.Open settings, and choose the “Sync” tab under “Plugin options” .4.Choose the remote vault to sync with.5.Keep the app open until all your files have synced over.To view the sync status of Obsidian Sync, swipe to pull out the right drawer, and you should see the statusindicator just like it shows on the desktop app.Tap on it to get more information, such as viewing the sync log todebug any issues.
Third party syncYou can also use your preferred sync solution to keep the local folder on your phone in sync with other devices.There are apps on the Play Store that let you sync a folder on your phone with other devices, for exampleDropsync or FolderSync.Storage PermissionWhen starting Obsidian, you may notice that it prompts for permission to access your device’s documents andmedia.In an ideal world, we’d prefer to only ask for access rights to the vault folders you choose.
However, Android’sprivacy-friendly file permission API (also known as “scoped storage”) has a few restrictions that makes itimpossible for Obsidian to function properly.The two biggest roadblocks are:Scoped storage performs many extra permission checks for every single file access, causing significantperformance degradation when opening and using Obsidian.Scoped storage does not provide a way to watch for external changes, which is critical when usingObsidian with a third-party synchronization tool.Google specifically gives instructions for developers of this kind of apps a special permission. Obsidian belongsto two categories in the list of exceptions: “document management apps” , and “on-device file search” .

You don’t want to put your ownbrain over someone else’s neck, do you? Treat your second brain the same way.Sync is only a utility to facilitate working on multiple devices, the data will always primarily live on your hard disk.When the file system replaces the cloud, you get flexible options to work with your files: you can back them upwith Dropbox, use Git to do versioning, or encrypt your disk for security.Whatever works on your file system willwork on your Obsidian knowledge base.==Links are first-class citizens==Links and connections are crucial to discovering the relations between what we know.Obsidian greatly values this, and encourages it with [Internal link] and [Graph view], among other things.As John Locke puts it…The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:1.Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.2.
The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this iscalled abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)Hierarchy gives us No.1, and linking gives us No.2.We’re still unsure what No.3 entails in the context of note-taking, but it might have something to do with programming or macros.==Your own toolkit==Note-taking is a highly personal activity.
Naturally there is no single all-encompassing solution for everyone.Instead of providing you with an opinionated and assembled product, [Obsidian] gives you a foundation andnumerous functional building blocks to discover and build your own solution.The foundation is to be able to view files, edit them, and search them.
For the minimalist, that’s enough.On top of that, you can add isolated, independent building blocks to add features to your note-taking:If you’re taking class notes, [Audio recorder] and LaTeX math might be useful;If you’re taking work notes, [Slides] and [Backlinks] may come in handy;If you’re a researcher, [Graph view] and [Word count] might be essential to your toolkit.We don’t expect plugins to be the silver bullet to solve all the problems, but it does get us closer than a monolithsolution, without all the features that you don’t need cluttering the interface.We support [[Customizing CSS|custom CSS]] and have a [[Community plugins|beta plugin API]], which willenable even more interface customization and support less common use cases.Follow our developmentObsidian is in public beta right now. We have a roadmap that you can check out.Our Twitter handle is @obsdmd, feel free to follow.

Playing a quiz game if you’re confident with your knowledge of the community plugins and themes.PluginsSlidesSlides lets you do simple presentations right inside Obsidian.Usage tips1. To separate slides, use newlines and the --- separator.2.To start a presentation, click this button after opening a note:![[Pasted image 14.png]]DemoCheck out the demo document: [Slides demo]Search![[Search.png]]Search is a powerful feature, and has the potential to be confusing.In most cases, if you just type what you wantto find, it will work.But search has many capabilities for narrowing down to find exactly what you want.Quick tipsStart searching You can invoke search by pressing Ctrl-Shift-F or Cmd-Shift-F .You can also customize this hotkey inSettings => Hotkeys.
When search is invoked, focus will be automatically put in the search bar so you can starttyping your query right away.Search selected textAfter you select text, you can search for it by simply invoking search like above.Search historyObsidian will remember your most recently used search queries.These queries will be presented to you when your search query is empty. You can click on any one of them tosearch for it again, allowing you to easily re-run previous queries.To clear search history, simply click on the “X” button.Search SettingsThere are a couple of toggles available while searching: Match case toggle case sensitive matching, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basisusing the match-case: and ignore-case: operators explained above.Explain search term will show you what the search query actually does in plain terms.Collapse results will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines inwhich matches appear.
These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the foldingtriangle next to the file name. Show more context will expand the display of the matches to show more text around the match.
Change sort order sorts the results by various orders, similar to how files are sorted in the [Fileexplorer].Copy search resultsTo quickly and easily take your search results to a list, use the “copy search result” option.You can customize whether you want to show paths, which link style to use (wikilink or Markdown link), and howyou want your list to appear.Embed search resultsYou can embed search results in a note.For example, if you write:query embed OR search You should see this embedded search view (note: it doesn’t work on [Obsidian Publish] as of 2020/01/18):embed OR searchSearch syntaxCombining sub-queriesWhen crafting a search query, remember that clicking “Explain Search Term” will give an explanation of what isbeing searched for, which can be very useful when debugging a complicated search.Words in the search query separated by space will be searched independently in each note. For example foo bar will find a note that includes both foo and bar anywhere in it.
"Quoted strings" can be used to search multiple consecutive words separated by space, or in otherwords, a phrase. So, searching for "foo bar" with quotes will only find notes that include those wordsnext to each other.You can use backslash \" to escape double quotes if you actually want to search for astring that includes quotes.And \\ will do the same for backslash.Boolean operations can be used.Use OR to match one or another.Use - to negate a query.The spacecharacter is used for boolean “and” .For example: foo OR bar will find all notes that contain either of those words, they don’t have tobe in the same note.foo -bar will find all notes that contain foo , but not if they also contain bar .Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations.For example ((a OR b) (c OR d)) .This can beuseful when crafting complex searches to make sure things happen in the order you want.Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search.
Use forward slash to denote a regular expression.For example: /[a-z]{3}/ . Obsidian accepts the JavaScript flavor regular expressions.You can learnmore about it here.Search operatorsSeveral special operators are available.Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: file:("to be" OR -"2B") .You can use - to exclude specific results from search, for example: foo -tag:#bar .file:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file name.For example: file:.jpg .If you useZettelkasten-style UIDs, this can be useful for narrowing a time range, for example file:202007 for filescreated in July of 2020.path:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root.For example: path:"Daily Notes/2020-07" .content:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file content.For example: content:"happycat" .match-case:(...) and ignore-case(...): will override the case sensitive match logic for thefollowing subquery.
tag: will search for your specified tag within a file, for example tag:#work . This is faster and moreaccurate than searching for the tag in plaintext #work , as it uses the cached information and ignores textin code blocks and sections that aren’t markdown text.line:(...) will perform the subquery on a line-by-line basis, rather than a file-by-file basis.Forexample, if you search for foo bar , this could match a file that has foo in the first paragraph and bar in the last paragraph.Searching for line:(foo bar) will only match if foo and bar are on the sameline.block:(...) will perform the subquery on a block-by-block basis, where each block defined as amarkdown block, typically separated by empty lines or list items.This is expensive computationally as itrequires parsing each file, which means this is likely slower than other modes.section:(...) will perform the subquery on a section-by-section basis, where each section is the textbetween two headings, including the first heading.
task:(...) will perform the subquery only on each [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use task:"" to match all tasks.task-todo:(...) will perform the subquery only on each uncompleted [[Format your notes#Tasklist|task]] and on a block-by-block basis.Use task-todo:"" to match all uncompleted tasks.task-done:(...) will perform the subquery only on each completed [[Format your notes#Tasklist|task]] and on a block-by-block basis.Use task-done:"" to match all completed tasks.Note composerThe Note composer plugin allows you to easily merge two note or extract part of a note into its own note.MergeWhen working with the file, you can choose “Merge entire file with…” in the More Options menu.Alternatively, you can open [Command palette] and invoke the command “Note composer: Merge current filewith another file…” .This will bring up a menu to choose a file to merge into.
Once you confirm the merge, all links to the current notewill be updated to the merged file.The current note will be merged to the bottom by default; you can use Shift-Enter instead of Enter tomerge it to the top.ExtractWhen selecting text, you can either right click on it, select “Extract current selection” , or use the [Commandpalette] to find the “Note composer: Extract current selection…” command.Similar to merging, this will bring up a menu to choose a file to extract into. If no result can be found, a new notewill be created.If you want to create a new note instead of using the first result, press Ctrl-Enter (or Cmd-Enter on macOS).Options Note Composer has a few helpful plugin options.Text after movingAfter you extract a piece of text, it’s often a good idea to leave a link to the new file.
By default, a link is created.But you can also change this option to have an embed created for you, or insert nothing at all.Template fileWhen merging or extracting, instead of just sending over the content, you can also apply a template file to it.This template file can contain the following variables: {{content}} : this is where the content will be placed. If you do not include this variable, the content willautomatically be placed at the bottom of the template.{{fromTitle}} : the name of the note where the new note comes from.{{newTitle}} : the title of the new file.Convenient if you prefer to have a heading at the top of the filethat’s the same as the file name.{{date:FORMAT}} : you can add multiple dates with your custom format.For example, you can do {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} and it will resolve to the date or time when the note gets created.Confirm file mergeMerging files will delete the file and is destructive, so by default we ask for your confirmation.
If you prefer, youcan choose to skip this confirmation.In case you accidentally merged something and want to get it back, consider using the [File recovery] plugin torecover it.File explorerThe File explorer shows [[Accepted file formats|the list of files Obsidian can recognize]] in your vault. You canopen notes, [create notes] and folders, and [rename notes] in it.Right clicking on a note or directory in the Fileexplorer will bring up appropriate options, such as renaming or making a copy.This is also the best way to setyour default folder for when you [Embed files].It’s one of the crucial plugins that we recommend you to keep enabled.Usage tips1.If the list of files is cluttering the interface though, you can close it:![[Pasted image 15.png]]1.You can drag and drop to put one file into another folder.2.
You can use the sort icon at the top to sort files by file name or last modified time.BacklinksThe backlinks plugin shows how the current note is referenced in other notes.After enabling it, you’ll see the backlink count in the status bar.In the right side bar (if it’s expanded), you should also see a panel that shows where the current note gets linked:![[Pasted image 9.png]]Upon expanding the “Unlinked mentions” section, you can also see where the name of the note gets mentioned,but not explicitly linked (in other words, mentioned without the square brackets).TemplatesThe Templates plugin lets you quickly insert snippets of text into your current note.Set up template folderEach template snippet is just a normal Markdown note, like everything else in Obsidian.To designate template files, put them into a folder, and choose that folder in Settings => Templates => “Templatefolder location” after enabling the pluginInsert a templateAfter setting up the folder location, using the ribbon icon to insert the template.
As always, you can also set ahotkey for this option, or use the command palette to access it.The template snippet will be inserted in the current caret position, with special text replaced by their actual valueat the time of the insertion (see below).Insert titleIf you want to insert the title of a note, you can set it in a template with {{title}} .Insert date and timeIn the plugin settings of Template, you can also set a date format and a time format.After setting these formats, {{date}} and {{time}} in the template files will be replaced by the formattingcurrent time.For formatting syntax documentation, please see here.Tip: if you want to have two date formats or two time formats, you can use the other {{time}} as the second {{date}} , or {{date}} as the second {{time}} . One-off date formatsIn addition to {{date}} and {{time}} , which will work in all template files, you can also write {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} to insert a date with a certain format just once.
This will override the {{date}} format. Anything after : will be considered part of the date format.{{time:HH:mm}} works similarly.Using custom date formats elsewhereCurrently, dates like {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} and {{time:HH:mm}} also work in the template file of the [Dailynotes] and [Zettelkasten prefixer] plugins.However, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work yet.Graph viewShows a graph representation of the [[Internal link|internal links]] between your notes.Notes with more notes referencing it appear as bigger nodes on the graph.![[Pasted image 10.png]]Visualization tipsYou can hover each node to highlight its connections, fading everything else.You can drag nodes around to rearrange the graph.
This may be helpful if some nodes are overlayingothers.Navigation tipsTo zoom, you can use mouse wheel scroll, as well as the + and - keys.To pan around, drag the background or use the keyboard arrow keys.Hold Shift while navigating with the keyboard to speed things up.Custom CSSSince the graph is rendered using <canvas> and WebGL, [[Customizing CSS|CSS]] is unable to affect thingslike nodes and links. To customize graph view, we have provided a way to convert CSS colors into WebGLcommands.The following CSS classes are supported:.graph-view.color-fill.graph-view.color-fill-tag (theme-dependent).graph-view.color-fill-attachment (theme-dependent).graph-view.color-arrow .graph-view.color-circle.graph-view.color-line.graph-view.color-text.graph-view.color-fill-highlight.graph-view.color-line-highlight.graph-view.color-fill-unresolvedtheme-dependent means you may have to add .theme-dark or .theme-light to style it for differentthemes.
See [[#Custom CSS#Defaults]] for explanation.The following CSS rules are supported: .graph-view.color-class {/* Supports all CSS color directives, like #HEX, rgb and rgba */color: #FFF;color: #FFFFFF;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);/* Opacity (similar to rgba) will make the color transparent */opacity: 0.5;}Defaults:These CSS rules are the ones Obsidian use by default. You may override any of them using an identical or morespecific CSS rule.
This applies especially to .color-fill-tag and .color-fill-attachment As a lastresort, add !important to the end of your rule..graph-view.color-fill,.theme-dark .graph-view.color-fill-tag,.theme-light .graph-view.color-fill-tag,.theme-dark .graph-view.color-fill-attachment,.theme-light .graph-view.color-fill-attachment,.graph-view.color-arrow,.graph-view.color-circle, .graph-view.color-line,.graph-view.color-text,.graph-view.color-fill-highlight,.graph-view.color-line-highlight,.graph-view.color-fill-unresolved {}Tag paneAdds a panel on the right that displays all the tags you have, along with their tag count.When clicking on a tag, a search for the tag is activated. To ==toggle a tag== in search, Ctrl-click it instead.SortingThe tags are sorted from most frequently used to least frequently used.
You can change the sort order toalphabetical or reverse it.Nested tagsIf you write your tags like #inbox/to-read and #inbox/processing , you can enable “show nested tags” toview them as a tree instead of a flat list.Under the default flat view, the tag pane will look like:- inbox/to-read- inbox/processingUnder the nested tag view, the tag pane will look like:- inbox - to-read - processingZettelkasten prefixerAdds a new button to the left pane, which can be used to create a new file and prefix it for you using the currenttime. This can be beneficial if you are a follower of the Zettelkasten UID-in-filename method.The default format is 12-digit timestamp, e.g.“202001010000” .TemplatesYou can define a [[Templates|template file]] for your Zettelkasten notes.This file will be copied when a newZettel note is created.For the Zettelkasten prefixer plugin, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work.
Please use {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} and {{time:HH:mm}} in your template.Word countWord count is a simple plugin that shows the word count of your current note in the bottom status bar.It works for CJK characters too (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), in which words are not separately by spacesbut rather glued together.OutlineThe outline plugin shows the list of headings for the current note, and allows you to navigate to another sectionby clicking on a heading.WorkspacesThe Workspaces plugin lets you save and load “workspaces” .
Each workspace includes pane layout, sidebar state(expanded or collapsed), and file open states.![[Pasted image 19.png]]Save a workspaceEither click on the workspace icon in the ribbon to open “Manage workspaces” .Give the current layout a new name, click on “Save” , and it will appear in the list below.Load a workspaceTo load or restore a workspace, either open “Manage workspaces” and click on the “Load” button next to theworkspace you wish to load, or use the “Load workspaces” command to bring up a command-palette-likeinterface to search and choose workspaces.CommandsThis plugin has two commands that you can access through [Command palette]: manage workspaces and loadworkspaces.
You can also define hotkeys for them.PublishThe Publish plugin lets you publish notes from your vault onto your site, all from within the Obsidian app.For more information about the Obsidian Publish™ service, what’s included, how it works, and privacy, see the [Obsidian Publish] add-on service.Enable the pluginFrom within Obsidian => Settings => Plugin, enable the Publish plugin. After that, a Publish icon (which looks likea paper plane) will appear in the ribbon pane.Once enabled, you can also set a hotkey for this option, or use the command palette to access it.Set up and Configure your siteWithin the Publish plugin, you’ll see an option to create a site by entering a unique site ID.Once published, yoursite will be available at https://publish.obsidian.md/{site-id} .After creating a unique site ID, you’ll have the option to give your site a name, select a home page, set a theme,and toggle various components such as graph view, table of contents, etc.
You can toggle these options byclicking on the gear icon near your site name at the top of the Publish plugin.Select files for publishingAfter setting up your site, you can now publish your notes!With a fresh, empty site, all your notes will appear under the “New” section, meaning they are new to your site.At this point, you may choose which files you want to publish, and then click the “Publish” button.==Privacy note: Obsidian Publish has no awareness (nor retention) of any notes you choose not to publish (norany notes you subsequently remove from your published site).==YAML support for PublishAs of 0.12.12, you can use YAML to flag notes to be published. (You can read more about YAML in Obsidian[[YAML front matter|here]].)If you set publish: true , then new files will be automatically selected the next time you publish changes.If you set publish: false , then the file will not be visble when publishing changes, and will not show up innew/changed files.
If this file had been previously published, you will see an option to delete it instead.If you do not use YAML to flag publish files, the default behaviour is to automatically select changed files, but notnew files.Make changesAs you make changes to notes that have already been published, those changes will be automatically selectedwhen you open the Publish plugin dialog.
You may uncheck any files you wish not to publish to your site.Change site options You can change various site options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name when in the “Publishchanges” dialogue.MetadataIn this section, you can set site name, home page file (the file visitors see when they land on your site), andmanage custom domain (please see [[Obsidian Publish#Custom domain|this guide]] to set up your customdomain).AppearanceHere you can change the theme between light and dark.If you want more customization, you can look into setting up [[Obsidian Publish#Custom CSS|custom CSS]] and[[Obsidian Publish#Favicon|favicon]].Reading experienceIn this section, you can:Enable a special mode called “sliding windows” that looks like Andy Matuschak’s notes;Enable page preview on hover like when using [Page preview] plugin in the app;Configure whether you want readable line length and strict line breaks.ComponentsYour site comes with a few components that you can toggle on or off.
These include:File explorer (default on)Local graph (default on)Outline (default off)Backlink at the bottom (default off)Search bar (default off, requires file explorer)SecurityHere you can set passwords to protect your site. Once set, all visitors need to enter one of the passwords toenter your site.Multiple passwords facilitate sharing with multiple groups.When you no longer wish to share with one group ofvisitors, you can simply delete that password.Each password can be named for your convenience as well.As of 2021/01/20, all notes on your site are protected by the same set of passwords.Add linked notes The “Add linked” button allows you to include for publishing any notes in your vault that are referenced (linkedto) by any currently selected notes.This is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site.By way of example, let’s assume you select Note A for publishing.
Supposing Note A has links to Note P, Note Q,and Note R, then if you click the “Add linked” button, Notes P, Q, and R will all be selected for publishing alongwith the currently selected Note A.Each time you click the “Add linked” button, the Publish plugin will look for links within every currently selectedfile to include for publication. Please be sure you review the list of selected files before clicking the “Publish”button.Delete published notesYou always have the option of removing any notes that have been published to your site.Within the Publishplugin, all published notes will be listed, of which any/all can be selected for removal.Deleting a note from yoursite does not remove the note from your vault, thus giving you the option to re-publish the note again in thefuture.Delete entire siteIf you’d like to delete an entire site, click the switch-site (arrows) icon near the top of the Publish plugin.Thenclick the X button to delete your site.
Note: this only removes your public site but does not affect any files in yourvault. You can always choose to re-publish your notes.Quick switcherThe Quick switcher lets you jump to other notes without leaving your keyboard.The shortcut to invoke it is Ctrl/Cmd+O .Just start typing, and matching filenames will be selected.Use up and down arrows to navigatethe results, Enter to jump to a result, and Esc to exit the quick switcher.Holding down Cmd/Ctrl will causethe note to open in a new pane.If you want to create a new note, typing a unique name will cause the Quick Switcher to create it.If the name issimilar enough to an existing note, the Quick Switcher will default to opening the original note.To avoid this,holding down shift will force creation of a new note with whatever name is in the Quick Switcher.
This can becombined with Cmd/Ctrl to create the new note in a new pane.![[Pasted image 11.png]]Before you enter anything, the top 5 most recently visited notes will be shown, so it’s also useful to quicklyswitch two notes by doing Ctrl/Cmd+O → Down arrow → Enter .File recoveryFile recovery is a core plugin to help you recover your data in case of all kind of accidents - user error, poweroutage, or misbehaving plugins and scripts.File recovery is default to enabled, because it’s too late to enable when you’ve already lost data. How it worksSnapshotsAs long as this plugin is enabled, full snapshots of what you’re working on get saved at fixed intervals (you canconfigure this interval).Snapshots get deleted after a fixed amount of retention time.This process is automatic.By default, snapshots are made every 5 minutes, and snapshots are kept for 7 days.RecoveringIn case of data loss, here’s how you can find saved snapshots:1.Open settings;2.
Open the “File recovery” tab under “Plugin options”;3. Click on the “View” button in “Snapshots” section;4.In the search bar on the left, enter the name of file you want to recover.If the file name does not show it, itmeans no snapshots were saved for that file;5.After selecting a file in the dropdown, a list of snapshots will appear on the left.Select the one you want torecover;6.The content of that snapshot will show up on the right.You can click “Copy to clipboard” to copy the wholething, or cherry-pick some of the content.OptionsSnapshot intervalMinimal number of minutes between two snapshots.Default is 5 minutes.History lengthNumber of days to keep snapshots around for.Default is 7 days.Clear historyYou also have the option to wipe all history.==Please be careful as this action is irreversible.==Data storageThe file recovery data is stored in [[How Obsidian stores data#System directory|system directory]] in case ofvault malfunctioning.
Please note that vaults are identified by their absolute path. If you’ve moved vault, you will need to move it backto its previous position in order to restore the snapshots while the vault was there.Markdown format converterIt allows you to convert from other variations of Markdown format and link convention to Obsidian format.Right now you can convert:Roam #tags to [tags]Roam ^^highlight^^ to ==highlight== Bear ::highlight:: to ==highlight== .Zettelkasten [[UID]] links to full links [[UID File Name]] Zettelkasten [[UID]] links to pretty links [[UID File Name|File Name]] , which will show up as just File Name Related[Format your notes]Outgoing linksThe Outgoing Links plugin shows the links from the current note at a glance, as well as potential links to bemade.
If you’re familiar with the [Backlinks] plugin, you can think of outgoing links as the opposite direction ofbacklinks.After enabling the plugin, you should see a new pane in the right sidebar, which contains two sections: “Links”and “Unlinked mentions” .LinksThe Links sections show links to other files, headings, and blocks. Clicking on a link will take you to that file.Each type will have its own icon for you to distinguish them; links to files that are not created yet have specialicons.Underneath the title, you can also see the folder path of each file.Unlinked mentionsIf any text in the current note matches the name or [[Add aliases to note|alias]] of another note in your vault, youcan see the context, highlighted match, and a button to Link it under “Unlinked mentions” .When you hover over the button, it will show the full path of the file if it’s not in the vault root.If you have multiplefiles of the same name, this can help you distinguish them.
Random noteRandom note does just that, opens a note at random from your Vault. Many people find this useful for surfacingthoughts they had not considered in a long time, or spot checking for things that they may have forgotten to link.After you enable the Random Note plugin, you can create a [[Custom hotkeys|custom hotkey]] that opens a noteat random.Core pluginsOne of the most powerful aspects of [Obsidian] is the ability to add new functionality via plugins.It comes withseveral already, and many more are in development.You can also build your own Obsidian plugin.See [Community plugins].Plugins can be managed through the “Settings” button on the bottom left.Some of them have settings of theirown that can be configured by clicking on the gear that appears next to each plugin when it is activated.Current list of core plugins1.[File explorer]2.[Search]3.[Quick switcher]4.[Graph view]5.[Backlinks]6.[Outgoing links]7.[Tag pane]8.[Page preview]9.[Daily notes]10.[Templates]11.

You can do so from a right click in the file explorer, a click on the optionsmenu of an open note, typing in the [command palette], or a hotkey that can be set in [Use hotkeys].Starred files and searches can be reordered by dragging them around.Daily notesDaily Notes will create a new note that is automatically named with the current date. If it already exists, it willopen that note.This is a useful way to create a daily log, todo list, or a list of links to notes that you have createdon a specific day.The date format and default folder for Daily Notes can be set in Settings => Plugins, by clicking the gear next tothe name.The default date format is “YYYY-MM-DD” (ISO format).This format means that a list of daily notes,listed in alphabetical order, will also be in chronological order.You can create a Daily Note either by clicking on the calendar icon in the left panel, or with the [Commandpalette].
You can also set a hotkey in [Use hotkeys].TemplatesYou can define a [[Templates|template file]] for daily notes. This file will be copied into your daily note when it’screated, so it’s a good place to put tags or links you use every day.For the daily notes plugin, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work.Please use {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} and {{time:HH:mm}} in your template.Command paletteThe Command Palette is enabled by default, as it is a very useful way to access nearly all the features ofObsidian without having to remember key strokes.Type Ctrl/Cmd+P to activate, then simply type in the nameof the command.If a command has a hotkey, it will appear in on the right side.Custom shorcuts can be added to the Command Palette in Settings => Hotkeys.Click on the * icon to the rightof each key listed and type whatever key combination you would like.SettingsPinned commandsYou can set a few pinned commands that will appear at top of the command palette.
This lets you choose themwithout typing anything. It’s a good place to put your most frequently used commands.Pinned commands are managed on the Command palette options screen under Plugin Options.You can addpinned commands by entering the name in the “New pinned command” field.After you pick a command and hit Enter , the command will be added to the list above.You can reorder the list or delete existing pinnedcommands in the list.Usage tipsTo see a list of all commands along with their shortcut, don’t type anything into the prompt.The arrow keyswill move up and down the list, and Return will activate the command.Search in the command palette is fuzzy, so you can type part of the word to get matches.For example, youcan use trm to search for “Toggle read mode” .Audio recorderAudio recorder is a plugin that lets you make a recording without leaving Obsidian.
It’s useful for class andmeeting notes when you can’t catch up for some reason, or for recording important discussions so you don’tmiss any details.To use, simply click on the microphone icon in the left panel:![[Pasted image 8.png]]The microphone will become colored while it’s actively recording.Click on it again to finish recording. The audio file is now saved in your [[vault]] and an embed the recording willbe added to the end of your current note.Open in default app Opens the current file with default app on your computer.
You can access it at the top right corner of the file topbar:![[Pasted image 5.png]]It’s useful for editing images or annotating PDFs, among other things.User interfaceWorkspaceTitle barTitle bar is the bar at the very top of Obsidian.Window titleThe window title, which is the text at the very center of the title bar, indicates the name of the current vault, aswell as the current version number.NavigationAt the left end of the title bar, there are two arrow buttons that let you go back and forward. Because howcommon they are used, we recommend using the hotkeys instead.Window managementAt the right end of the title bar, you have the buttons to:Minimize the window;Maximize the window if it’s not maximized, or restore previous size if maximized;Close the window.Native title barThe title bar in Obsidian is custom-built and may not have feature parity with the native title bar that you’re usedto on your operating system.Currently you can’t disable the custom title bar.
If it would be helpful to you, consider echoing your voice in thisfeature request.WorkspaceThe workspace in [Obsidian] contains the follow components:[Title bar][[Sidebar|Sidebars]] [[Sidebar#Panes|Sidebar panes]][[Sidebar#Tabs|Sidebar tabs]][Ribbon] (left sidebar only)[[Pane layout|Panes]][Status bar]SidebarObsidian has two sidebars on both left and right. The left sidebar includes the [Ribbon].Open hidden sidebarsIf a sidebar collapsed, you can open it by clicking on the Arrow icon to expand it.This commonly happens when you enable a plugin but cannot find it anywhere–chances are the new panecreated by the plugin is hidden in one of the sidebars.So be sure to check there!Ta b sBy default, plugins will only create new tabs instead of new [[#Panes]].You can switch between tabs by clicking on the icon.A tooltip will also appear to help you identify tabs.In each pane, you can only see one tab at every given moment.
Some actions will automatically bring a tab intoview, for example when you click on a tag.Close tabsSome tabs can be closed via the right click menu, but some cannot be closed. If you don’t want to see it,consider disable the relevant plugin or collapse the sidebar by clicking on the Arrow icon.Rearrange tabsAs of July 2021, there’s no way to rearrange the tabs.If you’d find this handy, echo your voice in this featurerequest.PanesYou can have multiple panes in the sidebar.Create panesTo get a new pane, drag the icon of a tab to above or below a current pane.The highlighted area will indicatewhere the new pane will be created.Close panesTo close a pane, you can [[#Close tabs|close all tabs in it]], or drag all tabs in it by their icons and drop them intoan existing pane.When only the tab area of a pane is highlighted, the tab being dragged will be dropped into that pane to mergewith other tabs in that pane.Status barThe status bar shows handy information.
That include helpful information about the current file, the current vault,or the current status like time and date.Status items are added both by [[Core plugins|core plugins]] and [community plugins].Some items are interactive but some are purely informational. For example, the [Word count] plugin adds theword and character count that’s not clickable, and the [[Obsidian Sync|Sync plugin]] adds an icon that bothshows the sync status as well as shows the sync log upon being clicked.PanesPane layoutOne of the things that makes [Obsidian] different from other note-taking apps is how easy it is to open multiplefiles in your preferred configuration.The window a file gets opened in is what we call a “pane” .You can have as many panes as you like.Open new panesOpen linksIn general, you can click a link to a file while holding Ctrl (on Windows and Linux) or Cmd (on macOS) to open itin a new pane.
This includes clicking on files in [File explorer], [Search] results, [Backlinks], [Graph view], etc.The only notable exception is in the editor. Because in the editor, a single click edits the link text rather thanfollowing it, Ctrl/Cmd-Click is used to follow the link.Therefore, you’ll need to hold Shift in addition toCtrl/Cmd in order to open the link in a new pane.Split current paneYou can also use the “More options” menu option of a pane to select “Split vertically” or “Split horizontally” toopen two copies of that file.Open linked viewsSome options in the “More options” menu will also open a new pane that’s linked to the current pane, such as“Open backlinks” and “Open local graph” .Rearrange panesTo move a pane, simply drag the pane icon in the top left corner of the pane.As you drag it around, a visualindicator will appear to show where the pane will be placed.
Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existingpane creates a horizontal or vertical split, and dropping in the center swaps positions with the target pane.You can also drag panes into the two sidebars. Panes in the sidebar work a bit differently, for more please seethe [[#Panes in the sidebar]] section below.Panes in the sidebarThere are some differences with panes that live in the [[Sidebar|sidebars]].Sidebar panes can share space with tabsWhen your drop a pane onto a sidebar pane, a new tab will be created under that sidebar section.
Differentpanes in the same sidebar section can be accessed by clicking on its tab icon.Sidebar panes do not show titlesThis reduces clutter, but also means it’s best to keep one or two important files like a scratch pad or the dailynote for quick access, rather than having a dozen files open.To see the title of a file that’s in the sidebar, hover over its tab icon.Sidebar can be easily collapsedIf there are panes that you only need to look at from time to time, having them in the sidebar makes it really easyto toggle them with a hotkey or command.Toggle editor and preview in sidebarThe hotkey to toggle between editor and preview only works in the main workspace. In the sidebar, you’ll need toright click on the tab icon and select “Preview” or “Edit” to toggle between two modes.Save and load pane layoutsThe [Workspaces] plugin makes it easy to come back to a particular pane layout.Give it a try!Linked panePanes can be linked together.
This has two main effects:By default, when opening a new [[Preview and edit modes|preview pane]] from an editing pane, the newpane is linked to the old one. This means that any changes you make in the editor will show up in thepreview in real time.It also means that scrolling one will scroll the other.When a new [[Working with backlinks|Backlink Pane]] is created from a note, it will be linked to that note.This means that [backlinks] will always be shown for the note that is in that pane.This is useful if you wantto reference a set of [backlinks] but let the regular backlink panel change with whatever other note you areworking on.Linked panes will be marked with a link icon.You can hover the link to see which pane it’s linked to, or click theicon to release it, so that they are no longer linked.
This will not close the previously-linked pane.RibbonThe ribbon is a space for common commands that occupies the vertical space at the very left of the interface.It’s part of the left [Sidebar] and is always visible, even if the left sidebar is closed.ActionsEach action is presented by an icon in the ribbon. Hovering them will present a tooltip; clicking or tapping themwill activate the action.The top ones are added by plugins, both [[Core plugins|core plugins]] and [community plugins].The bottom three actions are Obsidian system actions to:1.Open another vault;2.Get help (opens [[help vault]] on the [[desktop app]] and opens [[online help]] in the [[ObsidianMobile|mobile app]]);3.Open settings.Vault switcherVault switcher lets you switching between existing vaults and create new vaults.Open vault switcherTo open the vault switcher, click on the vault icon at the bottom group of the [Ribbon] actions.
The tooltip textshould say “Open another vault” .You can see the [[#current vault list]] and [[#create new vaults]] here. Because this is the first screen new userssee, it also displays name of the program and the [current version], along with a dropdown to switch [Interfacelanguage].Current vault listOn the left side of the vault switcher, you can see all the vaults you have accessed before on this device.Foreach vault, you can see the name of that vault (which is the name of the vault folder), and the path to that folder.Clicking on a vault in this list will open that vault.The cross icon lets you delete the vault from this list.Note: deleting a vault from this list will not delete the vault folder from your device.It will be “forgotten”and removed from the list.Create new vaultsVaults can be created in two ways:1.Choose “Create new vault” and enter the name of the vault along with where it will be stored.
EssentiallyObsidian creates an empty folder in that location and open it as a vault for you;2. Choose “Open folder as vault” and select a folder on your device.This is the recommended method if youalready have a backup or exported folder of Markdown files.1.meaningful!↩2.Here’s one with multiple paragraphs and code.Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.{ my code } Add as many paragraphs as you like.md You can also use inline footnotes.^[notice that the carat goes outside of thebrackets on this one.] You can also use inline footnotes.^[notice that the carat goes outside of thebrackets on this one.] ↩
